Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly. Here are the release notes from Cockpit version 230.

### Storage: List entries from /etc/crypttab that are still locked

Cockpit now lists those encrypted devices in the overview that are still
locked. This makes them easy to find if you want to unlock them manually.
